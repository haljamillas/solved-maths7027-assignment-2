 <li>In lectures we proved the result</li>

</ol>

via a somewhat circuitous route. Prove this result instead by using the principle of mathematical induction.

<ol start="2">

 <li>In lectures we derived an expression for the Maclaurin polynomial for cos(<em>x</em>).

  <ul>

   <li>Using this expression, find the Maclaurin polynomial of degree <em>n </em>= 2<em>k </em>for <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = cos(2<em>x</em>).</li>

   <li>Use Taylor’s theorem to estimate how many terms need to be used to approximate cos(2) to within 0.001. (Hint: For <em>f</em><sup>(<em>n</em>+1</sup>(<em>z</em>), think about what <em>y</em>-values cos(<em>x</em>) and sin(<em>x</em>) are both bounded by. You’ll need to use some trial and error to find <em>n </em>once you have a bound for the remainder.)</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Find the Taylor series for <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = ln(<em>x</em>), centred at <em>a </em>= 3, along with its interval of convergence.</li>

 <li>Consider the series, with terms <em>a<sub>n </sub></em>defined <em>recursively </em>by the equations:</li>

</ol>

for some given value of <em>k </em>∈N.

<ul>

 <li>Write out the first 6 terms of the series (i.e., up to <em>n </em>= 5).</li>

 <li>Use the ratio test to show that the series converges for <em>k </em>≥ 5, and diverges for <em>k </em>≤ 3.</li>

</ul>

<ol start="5">

 <li>Use Maclaurin series to compute the limit</li>
